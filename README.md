# conda-mobile

A collection of conda recipes for cross compiling libraries, python, and 
python extensions for iOS and Android.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/codelv/conda-mobile.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/codelv/conda-mobile)

The idea is to be able to easily create a python distribution that works on 
Android and iOS by simply using `conda install android-<package>` or 
`conda install ios-<package>` within an environment created for a specific app.

These recipes have been tested and confirmed working using a dev version of 
[enaml-native](https://github.com/codelv/enaml-native) (yet to be released).

### Targets

Currently all recipes are built for Python 2.7.15 and 3.6.5 with optional support for openssl and 
ctypes for the following targets:

- Android (arm (armeabi-v7a), arm64 (arm64-v8a), x86_64, x86 (i686))
- iPhone (armv7, aarch64)
- iPhone Simulator (x86_64, i386)

> Note: All libs and extensions are built as unstripped shared modules. Android strips
libraries automatically.

Packages are installed into the env using a prefix for the target platform as follows

- `iphoneos` - iOS recipes for the IPhone (armv7 and arm64)
- `iphonesimulator` - iOS recipes for the IPhone simulator (x86_64 and i386)
- `android/<arch>` - Android recipes for a given arch (arm (v7a), arm64, x86_64, x86)


Each target then contains it's own include, lib, and python folders as follows

```
# In <env>/<target> (ex miniconda2/envs/myapp/iphoneos)

iphoneos/include/ # All headers
iphoneos/libs/ # All shared libraries files
iphoneos/python/ # Python stdlib and site-packages 

```

Recipes can easily reference these locations using appropriate `CFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS`.

### Usage

This requires `conda`. The preferred method is to install `miniconda2` from 
[conda.io/miniconda.html](https://conda.io/miniconda.html).

1. Create an env `conda create -n myapp`
2. Activate it `source activate myapp`
3. Add this channel `conda config --add channels codelv`
4. Then install your apps dependencies using the the `android` or `ios` prefix. 
For example `conda install ios-python ios-msgpack`  


Pure python packages can be installed with pip using the `--target` to tell it
where to install. `pip install tornado --target=$CONDA_PREFIX/iphoneos/python/site-packages`
or (preferred) create a conda package for it using `enaml-native make-pip-recipe <package>`.

Once the packages are installed, the build system (gradle, xcode) can then easily grab 
these libraries from the env for the given target and use them as is. 

> Note: An import hook is required to load python extensions from "non" standard locations. 
[enaml-native](https://github.com/codelv/enaml-native) supports this. 


### Building recipes

Only developers of packages should need to build recipes. End users should
be able to simply install and use prebuilt versions. 

See the [conda docs](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/build-packages/index.html)
to get started.

There are three general recipe types that are generally relevant for conda-mobile: 
 
 1. Pure python packages, no extensions
 2. Python package with, with extensions
 3. Non python dependent libs


Pure python packages are prefixed with `pip-<package>` to distinguish them between regular
conda packages that may exist with the same name. You can create these package (almost) 
automatically using the [enaml-native-cli](https://github.com/codelv/enaml-native-cli)'s 
`enaml-native make-pip-recipe <package>` command.

Libraries with compiled extensions / cython components are split  into separate packages with 
the prefix `ios-<package>` and `android-package`. Otherwise all packages would need to be 
built from mac osx.

To add a new recipe or to build existing recipes:

1. Install `miniconda2`
2. Install conda-build via `conda install conda-build` (recommended outside of an env)
3. Clone this repo or create your own recipe(s)
4. Add the requirements to your recipes as needed
5. If building an extension or c/c++ library install `build-essential`,  `autopoint`, and `texinfo` with apt
5. Run `conda-build <recipe-name>` (python extensions must be built separately for 
    `2.7` and `3.6` by specifying it as an argument ex `conda-build --py 3.6 <recipe-name>`)
6. Then either add a PR or create your own repos with recipes.

> Note: If using linux with an encrypted home directory you may have to build in a different
root to avoid "path to long" errors. Add the `--croot=/tmp/conda` or some other path to 
fix this.

#### Recipe requirements

Now that both python 2.7 and 3.6 are supported all recipes that build python extensions MUST 
include `py27` or `py36` in the build string so conda knows which version to install. 
conda will do this automatically if you simply include `python` in the run 
requirements of your recipe (even though the ios / android version is actually used on the 
app). Alternatively you can manually set `string: py{{CONDA_PY}}` under the `build` section. 

In addition to specifying a build string, any requirements that have python extensions must
filter by the build string since conda does not do this automatically at the moment.

> Note: This only applies to python extensions. Pure c/c++ libraries do not need to do this!

For example:

```yaml

requirements:
  build:
    - python
    - cython
    - android-python * py{{CONDA_PY}}* 
    - android-libc++
  run:
    - python # Adding python here make conda append the py27 or py36 build string
    - android-python  * py{{CONDA_PY}}* # Required so it installs the correct pkg for the py version
    - android-libc++ # Pure c/c++ libraries do not need a "build" filter

```

Failure to include python as a run requirement may cause conda to install the incorrect 
packages (ie a 2.7 package may be selected for a 3.6 python build!).

In order to make your package "installable" from other operating systems (ie windows) the
recipe must use `noarch:generic` in the `build` parameters as follows.

```yaml

build:
    binary_relocation: False
    noarch: generic

```

The `binary_relocation: False` prevents conda from doing it's relocation logic on the
libraries created which can cause issues.
